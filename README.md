SCOOPS Ice-Cream Parlour is a family run, local business in Mullingar, Co.Westmeath. Providing home baked warm goods, memorable ice-cream desserts and delicious hot and cold drinks in a cosy environment.

## User Experience (UX)  
---  

### Primary Goal  
  
SCOOPS Ice Cream Parlour is a friendly, local ice cream parlour located just off the main shopping thoroughfare of Mullingar, Co.Westmeath, Ireland. They needed a clear and striking website design that reflected their traditional flavours and values. 

### Visitor Goals  
  
SCOOPS customers vary in age from child to elderly adult and it was a requirement that the website be straight to the point and easy to use for those seeking information about the menu, location and opening times. The site was designed to be responsive to allow visitors to view it from a range of devices and the menu was to have decipherable font from either portrait or landscape orientation. It was important for opening times and location of the shop to be accessible from every page via the footer. In addition an interactive Google Map is available to direct those not familiar with the town.

There was a clear need for an attractive and accessible website to represent this ice cream parlour and continue to drive their business.

They required an easy to read, dependable website that delivered clear information about menu options and opening times. For new visitors to the town, location of the shop must be visible and social media links available to check for customer reviews.  
  

### 2. Scope  

The SCOOPS site must be available on a wide range of devices due to the varied range of customer ages. A large portion of their client base is the retired, over-60 age group, comprising mostly of grandparents bringing their grandchildren out for a weekly treat. SCOOPS provides a comfortable, no-fuss, homely environment for its dine-in patrons and they wished for this to be reflected in the website. Text must be clear and legible on any sized device to allow the customer instant access to the menu, location and opening times. SCOOPS wished for a brief
